# dorm-supplies-api

In order to get everyone on the same page, everyone is going to work off of this backend repo.  It was created by agregating everyone's solutions that I looked over on github.  

##### Instructions

1. Clone this repo onto your local machine
2. Copy and paste your own `mongod.conf` file into `models/mongod.conf`
3. Start the repo as you would your original dorm-supplies-api
